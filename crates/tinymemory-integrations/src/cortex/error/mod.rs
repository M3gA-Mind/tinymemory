//! The engine's errors are the contract's errors.
//!
//! This module does not define a parallel `Error`. Every public operation is a
//! [`tinymemory_api::MemoryEngine`] method, and those return
//! [`tinymemory_api::Error`]; a second enum would only be converted into it at
//! every boundary and would invite variants the host cannot act on. So the
//! contract's enum is re-exported here as [`Error`], and
//! construction and configuration failures use [`Error::Config`].
//!
//! # How a CortexDB failure is classified
//!
//! | HTTP | Variant |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | 401, 403 | [`Error::Unauthorized`] |
//! | 402 | [`Error::InsufficientCredits`] when the hosted code names exhausted credits |
//! | 404 | [`Error::NotFound`] |
//! | 400, 413, 422 | [`Error::InvalidRequest`] |
//! | 409 | [`Error::Conflict`] |
//! | 408, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504 | [`Error::Unavailable`] (retried on reads) |
//! | anything else | [`Error::Engine`] |
//!
//! Transport faults (timeout, DNS, TLS, refused connection) are
//! [`Error::Unavailable`] too. A read retries an `Unavailable` three times,
//! and six (about 8 seconds) when CortexDB answers `503
//! AUTHORIZATION_STATE_CHANGED`, which a concurrent scope registration
//! causes and which settles on its own.
//!
//! **Why 402 has a dedicated variant.** An exhausted credit balance is neither transient
//! (`Unavailable` would invite a retry loop that cannot succeed until someone
//! tops up) nor a credential fault (`Unauthorized` would send the host to its
//! sign-in flow). It is the engine refusing to serve, which is what `Engine`
//! means; the hosted transport maps its structured backend code to
//! [`Error::InsufficientCredits`] so a host can show a top-up prompt.
//!
//! # The `[CODE]` prefix
//!
//! The TinyHumans backend names every failure with an `errorCode`. The
//! contract's `Error` has no field for it, so a hosted failure's message
//! starts with `[CODE] ` and [`error_code`] reads it back. Direct CortexDB
//! failures carry no prefix.
//!
//! Messages never carry a credential: the request builder marks the
//! credential header sensitive, and no message is built from it.
