//! Typed metadata carried by every stored item.
//!
//! [`MemoryMeta`] says where an item came from and what it is about: the
//! workspace, folder and file it was read from, the code language, the
//! repository and commit, the conversation thread and turns, the agent and tool
//! call that produced it, and the [`SourceRef`] that names its reader. Every
//! field is optional except the source, so a reader fills in what it knows.
//!
//! [`MetaFilter`] is the matching query side: the same fields as exact
//! matches (with `folder` and `file_path` also matching as a path prefix), plus
//! item kinds, source kinds, a tag set and an observation window.
